UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 9 SQL Challenge

The folder "EmployeeSQL" includes all of my necessary files needed for this assignment submission, while the "Starter_Code" folder includes the csv files used for the assignment.

- "EmployeeSQL" includes four files- "data_analysis.sql", "data_engineering.sql", "data_modeling.sql", and "data_modeling_ERD.png".
    - "data_modeling.sql" is my code for an Entity Relationship Diagram.
    - "data_modeling_ERD.png" is the diagram result of "data_modeling.sql".
    - "data_engineering.sql" is my code for creating tables based on the various csv files provided for us. 
    - "data_analysis.sql" is my code for the analysis section of the code/tables I created for the "data_engineering.sql" file. 

***All of the content within this challenge is either mine or provided by 'Starter_Code' when I first downloaded the assignment. I made use of Instructor help, class activities, and the UCI Bootcampspot's Xpert Learning Assistant.
